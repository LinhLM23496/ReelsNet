Use Flipper to view logs.

Since this project runs with TypeScript, when installing any library, make sure to check if it supports TypeScript. Some libraries on npm have built-in TypeScript support, while others require you to install the TypeScript definitions separately via @types/library-name.

For example, to install expo-image-picker, you should do:

ğŸ‘‰ `yarn add expo-image-picker`

ğŸ‘‰ `yarn add -D @types/expo-image-picker`
